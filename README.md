# A front end for and optical network simulator

In this project, we wrote a program in the C ++ programming language, which facilitates working with the Hegons optical network simulator. We wrote the program in Microsoft Visual Studio. With the implementation, we got more familiar with the operations and use of the Hegons program, but we also learned about the FLTK library and the gnuplot program that we used to perform graphical data input and display results. We will represent the programs used and the implementation and operation of the entire program.
